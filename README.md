# Surrealist City Editor by Atanas Laskov

Web-app that allows you to design your own version of a Surrealistic city in isometric 2D grid. 

## Development server

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`

## Running tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice.
To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component.
You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.
